## Description

A website for an archeticture compay that features an animated loading spinner that displays as the browser loads the page. The landing page itself contains an animated background that is created using keyframe animations. The about us section is displayed using css grid on larger screen sizes and switches to be displayed using flexbox on smaller screen sizes. The team section features cards that have hidden text that is revealed when the user hovers on each card. Tilt.js is used to create a tilting animation on each card that has the card react to where the users cursor is on the card. The site has a hidden navigation menu which is revealed when the user clicks on the hamburger icon which is fixed at the top of the viewport. Each link on the navigation menu has a hovereffect which was achieved by using the ::before pseudo element which creates a unique animation as the user hovers over each menu item.
